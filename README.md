# atlas-hack_sprint_adventure

This is the Hack Sprint for T2 at Atlas School. This Hack Sprint's theme is
"Travel." We are making a text adventure game that works on a website and a
mobile app. Multiplayer voting will be added if there is time.

The webpage front-end and back-end are in [Website](Website) (except for
[index.html](index.html), which has to be at the repo root in order for the
website to work with GitHub Pages), and the mobile app is in [Mobile_App](Mobile_App).
