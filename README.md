"Zytronium": The visionary behind the game, Zytronium conceived the idea of a text adventure that seamlessly integrates an Android app, a database, and a web app. He also spearheaded the development of the Android app, laying the foundation for the game's interactive storytelling.

John Wilson: As the architect of the website, John designed and implemented the game's web interface and its core functionality, ensuring players have an engaging and intuitive experience.

Khiry Dixon-Manning: The database wizard, Khiry developed and managed the game's database. He also established the crucial connections between the web app and the database, enabling seamless data flow and interactivity.

The team drew inspiration from classic sci-fi adventures and cutting-edge technology, combining their talents to craft a unique journey into the stars. Their collaborative effort highlights the power of teamwork and creativity.
