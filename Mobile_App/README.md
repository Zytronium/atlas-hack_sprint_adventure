# Mobile App

--------
This directory in the repository is for the Android mobile app version of this application.
The mobile will be able to be downloaded as an installable APK file from Itch.io and/or as a GitHub
release on this GitHub repository. The Android mobile app allows the user to play the text adventure
game on their phone without having to visit a website. This also allows for a better mobile
experience, as web pages are rarely designed to be optimal for mobile users, even if they are made
to be compatible with mobile devices. 

The mobile app uses the Firebase API to pull from the Firebase Firestore database to get the data
containing the story and options for the text adventure game.
